# User-Tracking-Database-Management-System
This is the course project for ISM Class Advanced Database Management Systems using Oracle. 

# Overview
This database was created to support a guest tracking system for a hotel chain. It allows the
owners of a hotel to enter the rooms available at their hotel, along with the number of beds and
maximum guest capacity, so that anyone looking for a hotel to stay in at a particular location can
easily find vacant rooms that fit their needs.

Using the data from the
database, it will be possible to check various types of statistics, like what types of room are the
most popular, which hotels have guests staying there the longest, and what times of the year
hotels in a given area are booked the most.

# Approach
## Database Design using ERD. 
Created a logical and physical database design from scratch and populated the database tables and relationships with appropriate constraints using Oracle

## Query Writing - General Purpose Important Queries that fits business use case
Wrote Queries like Most Popular hotel during summer time
-query to fetch preferred rooms in hotels
much more that fits business case. Please see the report for detailed explaination

## Performance Tuning and Indexing - To Optimize Query Performance
Utilized Techniques like 
1) B-Tree Indexing
2) Bitmap Indexing
3) SQL Tuning Advisor in Oracle
4) Query Optimization in Oracle to increase performance time on joins and expensive queries

## Data Visualization 
Used Tableau to visualiza the above queries

## Data Mining - Clustering using SAS Enterprise Miner
Clustered the similar hotels based on Users Preference using SAS Enterprise Miner.
